# PySiddhi

*You are currently in branch for PySiddhi 4.x*

The scope of this project is to develop a Python Wrapper on Siddhi CEP Library. The Python wrapper would support Siddhi 3.1 and Siddhi 4.0. A REST Client is also developed to interact with WSO2 Data Analytics Server (DAS) 4.0.

This is currently a work in progress, as a project for Google Summer of Code 2017 Program.

*Note: Currently the API is configured with __Siddhi CEP 3.1.0__ (in branch 3.x), __Siddhi CEP 4.0.0-M53__ (in branch master) and __WSO2 Data Analytics Server 4.0.0-M6__ (in branch master) for __Python 2.7.x__ and __Python 3.x__*

Project Goals
-----
1) Develop a Python Wrapper on Siddhi Java Library 3.1 and 4.0.
2) Extend the wrapper to support interactions with WSO2 DAS 4.0.
3) Testing, Documentation and Deployment

Installing the Library from Source
-----
1. Install following pre-requisites.
    - Python 2.7 or 3.x
    - Requests (`sudo apt-get install requests`)
    - Cython (`sudo apt-get install cython`)
    - Pyjnius (`sudo pip install pyjnius`)
    - Future (`sudo pip install future`)
    - Python Developer Package (`sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev python-dev`)
    - libboost for Python (`sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev`)
    - Maven and Java 8
    - g++ and other development tools 
      - `sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ autotools-dev libicu-dev build-essential libbz2-dev libboost-all-dev`
    - For use of WSO2 DAS 4.0 Client functionality, it is required to have WSO2 DAS 4.0 installed and running.
    (Refer _Running the Tests_ section for installation details)
2. Install using Setup.py.
    - Clone the relevant branch (3.1 or 4.0) from GitHub Repository.
    - Navigate to project root and run `sudo pip install .`

3. Use the Library using Python.
    - For Siddhi CEP 3.1
    ```python
    from PySiddhi3.core.SiddhiManager import SiddhiManager
    sm = SiddhiManager()
    ....
    sm.shutdown()
    ```

    - For Siddhi CEP 4.0.0-M53
    ```python
    from PySiddhi4.core.SiddhiManager import SiddhiManager
    sm = SiddhiManager()
    ....
    sm.shutdown()
    ```
    *Refer Tests to get more familiar with library functionality.

Running the Tests
-----
1. Install pre-requisites mentioned in `Installing the Library from Source` section.
2. Compile Java Libraries.
    - Navigate to `PySiddhi/PySiddhi4Proxy` and run `mvn clean install`
3. For running tests on WSO2 DAS 4.0 Client, it is required to have WSO2 DAS 4.0 installed and running. 
    - Obtain WSO2 DAS 4.0-M6 binary distribution from https://github.com/wso2/product-das/releases/tag/v4.0.0-M6.
    - Extract `wso2das-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip` to a suitable location (say `DAS_HOME`).
    - Navigate to `DAS_Home/bin/` and run `sh worker.sh`.
4. Run the tests cases in `PySiddhi/Tests` directory

*If mvn clean install throws errors, check the paths provided for imports of Python3 Developer Headers

Creating deployment wheel (for Linux)
-----
1. Install pre-requisites mentioned in `Installing the Library from Source` section.
2. Delete directory `build` if exist. 
3. Goto source root and run `python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name manylinux1_x86_64`

_Note: You need to use linux operating system to build linux wheels._

Creating deployment wheel (for Windows)
-----
1. Install pre-requisites mentioned in `Installing the Library from Source` section.
2. Delete directory `build` if exist. 
3. Goto source root and run `python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name win-amd64`

_Note: You need to use Windows operating system to build Windows wheels._

Installing deployment wheel 
-----
1. Make sure all pre-requisites are met. 
(You may have to separately install cython using `pip install cython` if you use _virtual environments_)
2. Install python wheel using `pip install [path_to_wheel_file]`.
